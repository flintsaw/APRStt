The * key is a delimiter between message types and # ends a string. The order of message types does not matter so long as they are separated by a * and the final character is a #

"A" - CALLSIGN (FCC calls, callsign suffixes, or tactical calls)
"B" - POSITION (Requires special configuration and coordination with users to work properly)
"C" - COMMENT (See below)
“D” – MESSAGE (Not currently implemented)

Partially completed transmissions will time out after 5 seconds of inactivity. If you make a mistake just wait and try again.

CALLSIGNs are encoded using the number key and A,B,C, or D to select the position of the desired character. Numbers with no modifiers represent numbers.

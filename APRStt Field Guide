"A" - CALLSIGN (FCC calls, callsign suffixes, or tactical calls)
"B" - POSITION (Requires special configuration and coordination with users to work properly)
"C" - COMMENT (See below)

Partially completed transmissions will time out after 5 seconds of inactivity. If you make a mistake just wait and try again.

To backcheck your callsign use (https://www.retroscape.com/aprstt/) but we wary that some translators are specifically for Satellite work and don't apply here.

APRStt - Touch Tone interface to the Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS)
Information here is modified for brevity and clarity from the version 2.3 user guide (http://www.aprs.org/aprstt/aprstt-user.txt)

"A" - CALLSIGN  (FCC calls, callsign suffixes, or tactical calls)
"B" - POSITIONS (pre-loaded or manually entered)
"C" - COMMENT   (comments or local voice freq you are monitoring
"D" - MESSAGES  (commonly used text messages for you or your family

Send position, comment, or message with a * before callsign. For example a message might be Dxxx*Axxx#

+------------------+  The standard TouchTone Key pad has letter
| 1    2    3   A  |  definitions for each key that we use for 
|     ABC  DEF     |  APRStt. For callsigns, we use the two-key
| 4    5    6   B  |  method where you first press the key associated 
|GHI  JKL  MNO     |  with the letter, and then press the A, B, C 
| 7    8    9   C  |  or D key depending on whether the letter is 
|PQRS TUV WXYZ     |  listed first, second, third or forth on that 
| *    0    #   D  |  key. A key alone is the actual digit.  The * 
|                  |  key is often used as a delimiter (,./) and # 
+------------------+  ends a string.
